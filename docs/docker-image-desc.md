# How to Use This Image

## Start a provider-ui-API Instance

Be sure to familiarize yourself with the repository's [README.md](https://github.com/bhits-dev/provider-ui-api) file before starting the instance.

`docker run  --name provider-ui-api -d bhitsdev/provider-ui-api:latest <additional program arguments>`

*NOTE: In order for this project to fully function as a microservice in the Consent2Share application, it is required to setup the dependency microservices and the support level infrastructure. Please refer to the Consent2Share Deployment Guide in the corresponding Consent2Share release (see [Consent2Share Releases Page](https://github.com/bhits-dev/consent2share/releases)) for instructions to setup the Consent2Share infrastructure.*
 
## Configure

The Spring profiles `application-default` and `docker` are activated by default when building images.

This project can run with the default configuration which is from three places: `bootstrap.yml`, `application.yml`, and the data which the [`Configuration Server`](https://github.com/bhits-dev/config-server) reads from the `Configuration Data Git Repository`. Both `bootstrap.yml` and `application.yml` files are located in the class path of the running application.

We **recommend** overriding the configuration as needed in the `Configuration Data Git Repository`, which is used by the `Configuration Server`.

Also, [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) supports other ways to override the default configuration to configure the project for a certain deployment environment. 

The following is an example to override the default database password:

`docker run -d bhitsdev/provider-ui-api:latest --spring.port=80`

## Environment Variables

When you start the PROVIDER-UI-API image, you can edit the configuration of the PROVIDER-UI-API instance by passing one or more environment variables on the command line. 

### JAR_FILE

This environment variable is used to setup which jar file will run. You need to mount the jar file to the root of container.

`docker run --name provider-ui-api -e JAR_FILE="provider-ui-api-latest.jar" -v "/path/on/dockerhost/provider-ui-api-latest.jar:/provider-ui-api-latest.jar" -d bhitsdev/provider-ui-api:latest`

### JAVA_OPTS 

This environment variable is used to setup a JVM argument, such as memory configuration.

`docker run --name provider-ui-api -e "JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx700m -Xss1m" -d bhitsdev/provider-ui-api:latest`

### DEFAULT_PROGRAM_ARGS 

This environment variable is used to setup an application argument. The default value is: "--spring.profiles.active=application-default, docker".

`docker run --name provider-ui-api -e DEFAULT_PROGRAM_ARGS="--spring.profiles.active=application-default,ssl,docker" -d bhitsdev/provider-ui-api:latest`
